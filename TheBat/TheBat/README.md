## Setup

Here are the instructions you should follow to replicate my BSPWM setup.
> 1. Dependencies
  
  You will need the following packages
  
  + **BspWM** - Obviously
  + **SXHKD** - Simple X HotKey Daemon [ FOR THE KEYBINDINGS ]
  + **Polybar** - Status Bar
  + **Alacritty** - Terminal used
  + **Dmenu2** - can be found in the repo's needed dependencies file [ Main Menu ]
  + **KsuperKey** - For some keybindings to work [ also will be found the needed dependencies file ]
  
****  
  
> 2. Install needed fonts

   You will need to install a few fonts (mainly icon fonts) in order for text and icons to be rendered properly.

   Necessary fonts:
   
   + **FontAwesome** - [ dependency for polybar ]
   + **Icomoon-feather** - [ can be found in ~/home/.config/polybar/fonts]
   + **Ubuntu-Condensed** - [ can be found in ~/.home/.config/polybar/fonts ]
   + **Any one nerd font** - [website](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)
>
>   
   - paste the .ttf fonts to `~/.local/share/fonts`.
   - It does not matter that the actual font files (`.ttf`) are deep inside multiple directories. They will be detected as long as they can be accessed from `~/.fonts` or `~/.local/share/fonts`.

   Finally, run the following in order for your system to detect the newly installed fonts.
   ``` in your terminal
   fc-cache -v
   ```
****   
> 3. Install my BSPWM configuration files

   ``` in your terminal 
   git clone https://github.com/Sam1431/Gentoo-BSPWM.git
   ```
>

****
> 4. Placement 
  
   ```
   Files in /Gentoo-BSPWM/.bin ----> /bin
   Files in /Gentoo-BSPWM/.config ----> ~/home/.config
   .mpd ----> ~/home [optional]
   .ncmpcpp ----> ~home [optional]
   compile the files in needed dependencies [ KsuperKey & Dmenu2 ]
   ```
